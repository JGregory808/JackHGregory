			<h1>Here's a little about myself</h1>
			<img id="profile" src="images/profile.jpg"><img>
			<p>I was born and raised in the state of Hawaii and, ever since I was just a 
			few years old, have always had a strong passion for technology. The sheer fact 
			that such small devices could hold such a large amount of information heavily 
			intrigued me. Before I knew it, I was tearing apart old computers, modifying 
			standard factory hardware and software on miscellaneous devices, and becoming 
			even more amazed at the power of and potential that technology has in our 
			daily lives.</p>
			<p>As I grew older and into my high school years, I started to become more 
			interested in the ways in which people and businesses can use technology to 
			make their lives and operations more efficient. When college application season 
			rolled around toward the last half of my career at 'Iolani School, I started to 
			consider what exactly I wanted to do in my future. I knew that I wanted to do something related to technology, business, and science, 
			but I really did not know what. After countless hours of researching schools, 
			I narrowed down my choices to schools with programs that would allow me to 
			simultaneously pursue both my technological and business interests. After all 
			was said and done, I was blessed to be accepted into multiple outstanding 
			programs that would allow me to carry my interests to the next level.</p>
			<p>I am currently a sophomore in Boston University's Questrom School of Business 
			pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration 
			in Management Information Systems, simultaneously pursuing a Bachelor of Arts 
			in Computer Science in the College of Arts and Sciences. As of now, I am working 
			as a summer intern at <a href=http://datahouse.com/>DataHouse</a>, communicating 
			with clients to develop websites and applications that fit their specific IT needs.</p>
			<p>In addition to my internship, I am currently teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
			jQuery, PHP, and Swift through online resources such as Udemy, CodeSchool, CodeAcademy, 
			and Treehouse. In fact, I built this website completely from scratch using the skills I
			started to teach myself at the beginning of summer 2015; there is no CMS to be found here.</p>
			<p>Outside of my tech and professional life, I spend the majority of my time outdoors.
			Whether it be hiking, running, or going to the beach, I love to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii
			every second that I can. Although I love Boston, there really is no place like home.</p>
